A brief document detailing the development flow for working on models

1. Select one or two models from the "candidates" section of MODELS.md
2. Create relevant issues for your models
3. Read relevant research, search for any code on the model
4. Develop/train model
5. Share the model output with the team. See if you can refine it, even if it meets everyones standards
6. Create a docker container containing the model. Run the container locally and see if it works
7. Open a PR
8. Once PR is approved, deploy the model live to Azure Functions and update relevant spec files for the new model
9. Go back to step 1 until all candidate models have been exhausted.
