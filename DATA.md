This document is a list of data used for the creation of generative models + potential leads / resources on acquring data. **The data itself lives in a shared Google Drive for the team**

## Leads:
A list of potential good sites for MIDI data to be used for model training.
* https://bitmidi.com/ (scrape maybe? Not the best idea since it is an unorganized collection)
* https://musescore.com/ (has a bunch of sheet music, If we can filter by genre might be worth a scrape?)
* http://abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/ (need to convert ABC Notation to MIDI)
* https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth#files (not in MIDI but in protobuf form)
* https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/bach-doodle (also in TFRecord protobuf form it seems)
* https://www.vgmusic.com/ 

## Resources:
Resources on how to collect data / where to collect data, and other relevant topics.
* https://musescore.org/en (for converting sheet music to MIDI)
