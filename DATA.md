This document is a list of data used for the creation of generative models + potential leads / resources on acquring data. **The data itself lives in a shared Google Drive for the team**

## Sources:


## Leads:
A list of potential good sites for MIDI data to be used for model training.
* https://bitmidi.com/ (seems easy to scrape?)
* https://musescore.com/ (has a bunch of sheet music, scrape?)

## Resources:
Resources on how to collect data / where to collect data, and other relevant topics.
* https://musescore.org/en (for converting sheet music to MIDI)
