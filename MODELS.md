A collection of what models are currently being used and leads for what models to try next

## Models used:

## Candidates:
List specific architectures here. For example "GANs" is NOT a candidate. Instead a good choice would be "Jazzy Chord GAN". You could also list specific architectures from literature. 
* Happy Melodic LSTM
* Jazz RL agent
* Major Scale Melodic Markov Chain
